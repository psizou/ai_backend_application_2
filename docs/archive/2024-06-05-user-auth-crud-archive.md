## 2. QA Summary
- Registration, login, and JWT authentication tested and working.
- User CRUD endpoints protected and functional.
- Database schema and seed data verified.
- No migration or configuration conflicts.
- Logging and error handling provide good visibility.
- Docker Compose and local development setup are clean and simple.

## 3. Reflection Highlights
- See `reflection.md` for full details.
- Successes: All core requirements met, robust error handling, clean configuration.
- Challenges: Migration/sequence issues, password handling, debugging, PowerShell quirks.
- Lessons: Importance of sequence resets, decoupling auth, detailed logging, minimal configs, thorough testing.
- Improvements: Automate migrations, add more integration tests, use DTOs, enhance error responses, document API with Swagger.
