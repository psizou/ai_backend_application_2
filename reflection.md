# Reflection: Spring Boot User Management & Authentication System

## 1. Review Implementation & Comparison to Plan
- Implemented a RESTful API for user CRUD and JWT authentication.
- Used a normalized schema (users, address, company, geo, auth) and loaded seed data from JSONPlaceholder.
- Removed all unnecessary code (posts, comments, etc.).
- Cleaned up configuration and Docker Compose to only run the database.
- Added logging and error handling for key flows.

## 2. Successes
- Registration and login work as expected, with JWT returned and validated.
- User CRUD endpoints are protected and function correctly.
- Database schema matches requirements and loads seed data.
- No migration or configuration conflicts.
- Logging and error handling provide good visibility.
- Docker Compose and local development setup are clean and simple.

## 3. Challenges
- Migration issues: Foreign key constraints and sequence resets required careful handling.
- Password handling: Refactored logic to use a separate `auth` table.
- Debugging: Some errors (e.g., 500s, 400s) required detailed log analysis and improved logging.
- PowerShell quirks: Occasional issues with command output and buffer size.
- Ensuring full user objects are sent for updates to avoid partial updates.

## 4. Lessons Learned
- Always reset sequences after inserting seed data with explicit IDs.
- Decoupling authentication from user entity (using an `auth` table) improves security and maintainability.
- Detailed logging in authentication and registration flows is invaluable for debugging.
- Keeping configuration files minimal and environment-driven prevents conflicts.
- Testing with both manual and automated tools is essential for robust QA.

## 5. Process/Technical Improvements
- Automate database migration and sequence reset in CI/CD.
- Add more integration tests for edge cases (invalid JWT, forbidden updates, etc.).
- Consider using DTOs for all API input/output to decouple entity and API models.
- Enhance error responses with more structured error codes/messages.
- Document API endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI for easier manual QA.
